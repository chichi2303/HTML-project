            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Since I was a little kid, I have always been really enjoyed playing games. 
            I can spend a lot of time playing. Mario was the first one that I played. I used to play on my
            NES controller that my parents bought me for my birthday when I was 5. Of course I did not get a
            chance to play Mario. I was the second child, hence, Luigi :(. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the list of games I 
            think are good and worth the time (Not limited to one platform).
            <ul class="spacing">
                <li>Mario (yeah, the classic)</li>
                <li>Assiassin's Creed (Mature rated, but it is really fun to hunt some templars down)</li>
                <li>Pokemon (Gotta catch them all! ~Not really ...)</li>
                <li>League of Legends (Beware ragers and flamers!)</li>
                <li>Prince of Persia (Personally, I enjoyed the puzzles more than the fighting)</li>
                <li>Monkey Island (all 5, the puzzles are really fun, but furstrated sometimes)</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="spacing" style="padding-top:25em;">
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; My dad taught me how to play chess when I was 6 because my parents finally
            came to agree that too much video games were actually unhealthy for me. My dad is really good at
            many different types of chess so I was able to learn a few from him. I learned to play Western chess,
            Chinese chess, and Go chess. <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, even though I liked playing those, I cannot say I'm really good at those 
            since the only two person I practiced with were my dad and my sister. My dad was unbeatable and my sister
            was easy to beat :(, so it was like toggle between an easy and a hard mode.
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; However, one time I did beat my grandpa in Western chess, when he was a very good chess
            player himself, so I was quite proud of myself

        <p class="spacing" style="padding-top:25em;">
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I love sports. Throughout my childhood, I played many types of sports, but 
            my favorite one is soccer. I used to play with my sister and my cousins. When I grew older, 
            I joined the soccer club so I can play with more people<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; My coaches were really nice and loved teaching us how to control the ball, how to 
            play with each other. I learned how to play with teammates, how to do trick with the balls, and how
            to read the game. They were really great coaches.

            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I like coding because I have fun doing those. I like working on the problems 
            and finding out the solutions. Of course, sometimes it is indeed furstrating. However, the feeling of
            figuring out how to do a hard problem is priceless and nothing can beat it. <br />
