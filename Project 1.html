        So I was wondering what would be a nice project to work on. I couldn't come up with anything yet, but then I told myself "why not sharing your learning experiences?"
        So here I am, writing a small blog to show a footage of my development in HTML.
        This is the very first version of my blog. Throughout my HTML, I hope I can show my improvement with every piece of my amateur project.
        So there is it for now!
